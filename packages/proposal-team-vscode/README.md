## Features

Use `@proposal-team` in VS Code Chat with these commands:

| Command    | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/setup`   | Initialize project directory structure                                   |
| `/analyze` | Analyze a solicitation — extract requirements, evaluation factors, risks |
| `/outline` | Create a Blue Outline with section-by-section writing instructions       |
| `/draft`   | Draft one or more proposal sections as proposal-ready prose              |
| `/review`  | Run a multi-agent proposal review with debate rounds                     |
| `/run`     | Full end-to-end workflow: analyze → outline → draft → review             |

You can also ask general proposal questions without a command:

```
@proposal-team How should I structure my past performance volume?
```

## Agent Team

| Agent                           | Focus                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Growth Strategist**           | Win themes, discriminators, competitive positioning |
| **Solution Architect**          | Solution coherence, staffing, technology alignment  |
| **Subject Matter Expert**       | Technical correctness, methodology, feasibility     |
| **Compliance Reviewer**         | Requirements coverage, Section L/M traceability     |
| **Past Performance Specialist** | Relevance, STAR narratives, CPARS context           |

## Workflow

1. **Setup:** `@proposal-team /setup` — creates project directories
2. **Add documents:** Place solicitation files in `solicitation/`, context in `context/`
3. **Analyze:** `@proposal-team /analyze` — produces compliance matrix and analysis
4. **Outline:** `@proposal-team /outline` — creates Blue Outline with writing instructions
5. **Draft:** `@proposal-team /draft Technical Approach` — drafts sections
6. **Review:** Move drafts to `proposal/`, then `@proposal-team /review`

Or use `@proposal-team /run` to walk through all phases with checkpoints.

## Directory Structure

After `/setup`, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── solicitation/     ← Drop RFP, SOW, amendments here
├── proposal/         ← Drop proposal drafts here for review
├── context/          ← Win themes, proof points, capture intel
│   ├── extracted/
│   ├── program-and-customer-intel/
│   └── solutioning/
├── output/           ← Generated analysis, outlines, reports
│   └── drafts/       ← Generated draft sections
├── templates/        ← Output format templates
└── CLAUDE.md         ← System documentation
